# NBA Shot Prediction - Maximizing Chances of Victory in Basketball

## Project Overview

Our objective is to build a shot prediction model, whether the player will score or not score, based on the data analysis that we conduct after taking the shots and the circumstances under which they are made into consideration, to help all stakeholders develop more effective game strategies. 
In building our models, our data mining goal is to find the best model that has the highest accuracy and F1-score.
